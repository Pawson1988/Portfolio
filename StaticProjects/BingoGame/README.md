# BingoGame

This is a bingo game made without tutorials just the knowledge that I've amassed while learning to code.

It's a classic bingo game that is played in the UK with 90 numbers called at random. 

The bingo cards themselves have 9 columns and 3 rows... 
They have 5 numbers on each row and the rows go from singles numbers, tens, twenties and so on. 
However, there are also five blank spaces on each row at random. 
If there are numbers in the same column they have to go from lowest to highest from top to bottom. 

This was a challenge but I created an algorithm that generates the bingo playing card. 

To play this game you have to choose a card by pressing the choose a card button, whilst you haven't called a number you can generate as many random cards 
as you want and choose one to play. 

Once you've called a number either manually or choosing the automatic option, you have to stick with the numbers you have chosen or just refresh the page.... 

There are options to call manually by clicking each number or you can sit back and watch it do it by itself... 

You can also stop the auto call and start maually again or restart the automatic calling. 

The game will stop once you've won the full house.

There is a display of numbers from 1 to 90 that's marked off as the numbers are called and slo a dispaly of the current number called and the current number of calls.
